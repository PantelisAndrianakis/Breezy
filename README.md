### What is Breezy?

Breezy is a programming language that blends Java-inspired syntax with full C++ code generation.<br>
The language is designed to ease developers familiar with Java, making programming more intuitive.

### Key Characteristics
- **Java-inspired syntax**: Familiar for developers who want a streamlined experience while still targeting C++.
- **Full C++ Support**: Generates clean and efficient C++ code without any reliance on other intermediaries.
- **Memory Management**: Breezy generates pure C++ code, giving you control over memory management.

### A Note on Breezy

Think of Breezy as a language inspired by Java... but with the power of C++.<br>
It's like emulating Java, with the help of a language that emulates Java, in a language that inspired both.<br>
No compromisesâ€”just pure efficiency, with a touch of familiarity for those who miss their semicolons.<br>
Breezy was developed purely for fun, after losing my mind on attempting to build a complex transpiler.
