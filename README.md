### A Note on Breezy

Think of Breezy as a language inspired by Java... but with the power of C++.<br>
It's like emulating Java, with the help of a language that emulates Java, in a language that inspired both.<br>
No compromisesâ€”just pure efficiency, with a touch of familiarity for those who miss their semicolons.<br>
Breezy was developed purely for fun, following the challenges of building a complex transpiler.
